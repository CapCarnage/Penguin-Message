Hey there, I have a msg for the most beautiful girl in the whole world Karin Kearney. It's a letter from your boyfriend sent directly by penguin mail for you. In it he says that he's sorry that he can be a bit of a dummy sometimes and that he can accidentally hurt you. He wants you to know though that he would never in a million years hurt you on purpose in any way shape or form and he feels terrible when he does accidentally hurt you :(.

He knows as well that he has a tendency to overthink or to not listen when you tell him something is fine or okay 50 different times and other flawsüòÖ but he's trying to work on it and be a better man and boyfriend to you.

He just wants you to know without a shadow of a doubt that all he wants with every fiber of his being is to keep you safe, make you happy and keep you laughing and smiling and to always always always always always ALWAYS! make you feel loved because he does with all his heart love you and ONLY YOU! his girlfriend, his wifey and his soulmate ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Well that's the letter he wrote for you ma'am, I'll be off but he sounds like a really lucky guy if he was made as your soulmate if you don't mind this penguin saying. Anyway I'll be off goodbye ma'am ‚ù§Ô∏è
